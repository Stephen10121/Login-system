# Login-system
This login system is inspired by mmtuts, he showed how to do everything

This Repository has to go onto a server because php files only run on servers. 
I used xampp because it is easy. Put the files in a folder and add the folder
into the htdocs folder in the xampp folder in the C: drive. 
Open the xampp control panel in that same xampp folder and start the apache 
and mysql server and run it.
